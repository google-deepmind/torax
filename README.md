## What is TORAX?

TORAX is a differentiable tokamak core transport simulator aimed for fast
and accurate forward modelling, pulse-design, trajectory optimization, and
controller design workflows. TORAX is written in Python using JAX, with
the following motivations:

- Open-source and extensible, aiding with flexible workflow coupling
- JAX provides auto-differentiation capabilities and code compilation for fast runtimes. Differentiability allows for gradient-based nonlinear PDE solvers for fast and accurate modelling, and for sensitivity analysis of simulation results to arbitrary parameter inputs, enabling applications such as trajectory optimization and data-driven parameter identification for semi-empirical models. Auto-differentiability allows for these applications to be easily extended with the addition of new physics models, or new parameter inputs, by avoiding the need to hand-derive Jacobians
- Python-JAX is a natural framework for the coupling of ML-surrogates of physics models

For more comprehensive documentation, see our [readthedocs page](https://torax.readthedocs.io/).

TORAX now has the following physics feature set:

- Coupled PDEs of ion and electron heat transport, electron particle transport, and current diffusion
    - Finite-volume-method
    - Multiple solver options: linear with Pereverzev-Corrigan terms and the predictor-corrector method, nonlinear with Newton-Raphson, nonlinear with optimization using the jaxopt library
- Ohmic power, ion-electron heat exchange, fusion power, Bremsstrahlung, and bootstrap current with the analytical Sauter model
- Time dependent boundary conditions, sources, geometry.
- Coupling to the QLKNN10D [[van de Plassche et al, Phys. Plasmas 2020]](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5134126) QuaLiKiz-neural-network surrogate for physics-based turbulent transport
- General geometry, provided via CHEASE or FBT equilibrium files
    - For testing and demonstration purposes, a single CHEASE equilibrium file is available in the data/geo directory. It corresponds to an ITER hybrid scenario equilibrium based on simulations in [[Citrin et al, Nucl. Fusion 2010]](https://doi.org/10.1088/0029-5515/50/11/115007), and was obtained from [PINT](https://gitlab.com/qualikiz-group/pyntegrated_model). A PINT license file is available in data/geo.
    - Time dependent geometry is supported by provided a time series of geometry files

Additional heating and current drive sources can be provided by prescribed
formulas, user-provided analytical models, or user-provided prescribed data.

Model implementation was verified through direct comparison of simulation
outputs to the RAPTOR

## Feature roadmap

Short term development plans include:

- Implementation of forward sensitivity calculations w.r.t. control inputs and parameters
- More extensive documentation and tutorials
- Visualisation improvements

Longer term planned features include:

- Sawtooth model (Porcelli + reconnection)
- Neoclassical tearing modes (modified Rutherford equation)
- Neoclassical transport + multi-ion transport, with a focus on heavy impurities
- IMAS coupling
- Stationary-state solver
- Momentum transport

Contributions in line with the roadmap are welcome. In particular, TORAX
is envisaged as a natural framework for coupling of various ML-surrogates of
physics models. These could include surrogates for turbulent transport,
neoclassical transport, heat and particle sources, line radiation, pedestal
physics, and core-edge integration, MHD, among others.

## Installation guide

### Requirements

Install Python 3.10 or greater.

Make sure that tkinter is installed:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

### How to install

#### Prepare a virtual environment

Install virtualenv (if not already installed):

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
```

```shell
pip install virtualenv
```

Create a code directory where you will install the virtual env and other TORAX
dependencies.

```shell
mkdir /path/to/torax_dir && cd "$_"
```
Where `/path/to/torax_dir` should be replaced by a path of your choice.

Create a TORAX virtual env:

```shell
python3 -m venv toraxvenv
```

Activate the virtual env:

```shell
source toraxvenv/bin/activate
```

#### Install QLKNN-hyper

Download QLKNN-hyper dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/qualikiz-group/qlknn-hyper.git
```

```shell
export TORAX_QLKNN_MODEL_PATH="$PWD"/qlknn-hyper
```

It is recommended to automate the environment variable export. For example, if
using bash, run:

```shell
echo export TORAX_QLKNN_MODEL_PATH="$PWD"/qlknn-hyper >> ~/.bashrc
```
The above command only needs to be run once on a given system.

#### (Optional) Install QLKNN_7_11

Optionally, you can instead use QLKNN_7_11, a more recent surrogate model:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/fusion_transport_surrogates.git
pip install -e ./fusion_transport_surrogates
export TORAX_QLKNN_MODEL_PATH="$PWD"/fusion_transport_surrogates/fusion_transport_surrogates/models/qlknn_7_11.qlknn
```

We recommend automating the variable export. If using bash, run:

```shell
echo export TORAX_QLKNN_MODEL_PATH="$PWD"/fusion_transport_surrogates/fusion_transport_surrogates/models/qlknn_7_11.qlknn >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### Install TORAX

Download and install the TORAX codebase via http:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/torax.git
```
or ssh (ensure that you have the appropriate SSH key uploaded to github).

```shell
git clone git@github.com:google-deepmind/torax.git
```
Enter the TORAX directory and pip install the dependencies.

```shell
cd torax; pip install -e .
```

From within the top level directory where you `pip install` from, also set the
geometry data directory.

```shell
export TORAX_GEOMETRY_DIR="$PWD"/torax/data/third_party/geo
```

As with the QLKNN dependencies, we recommend automating the variable export. If
using bash, run:

```shell
echo export TORAX_GEOMETRY_DIR="$PWD"/torax/data/third_party/geo >> ~/.bashrc
```
The above command only needs to be run once on a given system.

If you want to install with the dev dependencies (useful for running `pytest`
and installing `pyink` for lint checking), then run with the `[dev]`:

```shell
cd torax; pip install -e .[dev]
```

Optional: Install additional GPU support for JAX if your machine has a GPU:
https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#supported-platforms

### Running an example

The following command will run TORAX using the default configuration file
`examples/basic_config.py`.

```shell
python3 run_simulation_main.py --config='torax.examples.basic_config'
```

Simulation progress is shown by a progress bar in the terminal, displaying
the current simulation time, and the percentage of the total simulation time
completed.

To run more involved, ITER-inspired simulations, run:

```shell
python3 run_simulation_main.py --config='torax.examples.iterhybrid_rampup'
```

and

```shell
python3 run_simulation_main.py --config='torax.examples.iterhybrid_predictor_corrector'
```

Additional configuration is provided through flags which append the above
run command, and environment variables. For example, for increased output
verbosity, can run with the `--log_progress` flag.

```shell
python3 run_simulation_main.py \
   --config='torax.examples.iterhybrid_rampup' --log_progress
```

#### Set environment variables

Path to the QuaLiKiz-neural-network parameters. Note: if installation
instructions above were followed, this may already be set.

```shell
$ export TORAX_QLKNN_MODEL_PATH="<myqlknnmodelpath>"
```

Path to the geometry file directory. This prefixes the path and filename
provided in the `geometry_file` geometry constructor argument in the run
config file. If not set, `TORAX_GEOMETRY_DIR` defaults to the relative path
`torax/data/third_party/geo`.

```shell
$ export TORAX_GEOMETRY_DIR="<mygeodir>"
```

If true, error checking is enabled in internal routines. Used for debugging.
Default is false since it is incompatible with the persistent compilation cache.

```shell
$ export TORAX_ERRORS_ENABLED=<True/False>
```

If false, JAX does not compile internal TORAX functions. Used for debugging.
Default is true.

```shell
$ export TORAX_COMPILATION_ENABLED=<True/False>
```

The following implements the JAX persistent cache and will cause jax to store
compiled programs to the filesystem, reducing recompilation time in some cases:

```shell
$ export JAX_COMPILATION_CACHE_DIR=<path of your choice, such as ~/jax_cache>
$ export JAX_PERSISTENT_CACHE_MIN_ENTRY_SIZE_BYTES=-1
$ export JAX_PERSISTENT_CACHE_MIN_COMPILE_TIME_SECS=0.0
```

#### Set flags
Output simulation time, dt, and number of stepper iterations (dt backtracking
with nonlinear solver) carried out at each timestep.

```shell
python3 run_simulation_main.py \
   --config='torax.examples.iterhybrid_predictor_corrector' \
   --log_progress
```

Live plotting of simulation state and derived quantities.

```shell
python3 run_simulation_main.py \
   --config='torax.examples.iterhybrid_predictor_corrector' \
   --plot_progress
```

Combination of the above.

```shell
python3 run_simulation_main.py \
   --config='torax.examples.iterhybrid_predictor_corrector' \
   --log_progress --plot_progress
```

### Post-simulation

Once complete, the time history of a simulation state and derived quantities
is written to `state_history.nc`. The output path is written to stdout.

To take advantage of the in-memory (non-persistent) cache, the process does not
end upon simulation termination. It is possible to modify the runtime_params,
toggle the `log_progress` and `plot_progress` flags, and rerun the simulation.
Only the following modifications will then trigger a recompilation:

- Grid resolution
- Evolved variables (equations being solved)
- Changing internal functions used, e.g. transport model, or time_step_calculator

### Cleaning up

You can get out of the Python virtual env by deactivating it:

```shell
deactivate
```
