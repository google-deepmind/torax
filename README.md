## What is TORAX?

TORAX is a differentiable tokamak core transport simulator aimed for fast
and accurate forward modelling, pulse-design, trajectory optimization, and
controller design workflows. TORAX is written in Python using JAX, with
the following motivations:

- Open-source and extensible, aiding with flexible workflow coupling
- JAX provides auto-differentiation capabilities and code compilation for fast
runtimes. Differentiability allows for gradient-based nonlinear PDE solvers for
fast and accurate modelling, and for sensitivity analysis of simulation results
to arbitrary parameter inputs, enabling applications such as trajectory
optimization and data-driven parameter identification for semi-empirical models.
Auto-differentiability allows for these applications to be easily extended with
the addition of new physics models, including ML-surrogates, or new parameter
inputs, by avoiding the need to hand-derive Jacobians
- Python-JAX is a natural framework for the coupling of ML-surrogates of physics
models

For more comprehensive documentation, see our [readthedocs page](https://torax.readthedocs.io/).

TORAX, at v1.0.0, has the following physics and numerics feature set:

- Coupled PDEs of ion and electron heat transport, electron particle transport,
and current diffusion
    - Finite-volume-method discretization
    - Multiple solver options: linear with Pereverzev-Corrigan terms and the
    predictor-corrector method, nonlinear with Newton-Raphson, nonlinear with
    optimization using the jaxopt library
    - Poloidal flux boundary conditions based on either total current or loop
    voltage at the last-closed-flux-surface
- Ohmic power, ion-electron heat exchange, fusion power, Bremsstrahlung,
impurity line radiation, an [[ICRH ML-surrogate]](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DPP24/Session/NP12.106) (as-yet covering limited regimes),
- Neoclassical bootstrap current and conductivity with the analytical Sauter
  model
- Coupling to the [[QLKNN_7_11]](https://github.com/google-deepmind/fusion_surrogates/)
and QLKNN10D

QuaLiKiz neural network surrogates for physics-based turbulent transport
- General geometry, provided via CHEASE, FBT, or EQDSK equilibrium files
    - For testing and demonstration purposes, a single CHEASE equilibrium file
    is available in the `data/third_party/geo` directory. It corresponds to an
    ITER hybrid scenario equilibrium based on simulations in
    [[Citrin et al, Nucl. Fusion 2010]](https://doi.org/10.1088/0029-5515/50/11/115007),
    and was obtained from [PINT](https://gitlab.com/qualikiz-group/pyntegrated_model).
    A PINT license file is available in `data/third_party/geo`
    - Time dependent geometry is supported by providing a time series of geometry files
- Simple pedestal models using a local adaptive source to set internal boundary
conditions
- Sawtooth triggering and profile redistribution

Additional heating and current drive sources can be provided by user-provided
analytical models, or user-provided prescribed data.

Model implementation was verified through direct comparison of simulation
outputs to the RAPTOR

## Development roadmap

A [development roadmap](https://torax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roadmap.html#development-roadmap)
is outlined in our readthedocs pages.

## Installation guide

### Requirements

Install Python 3.10 or greater.

Make sure that tkinter is installed:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

### How to install

#### Prepare a virtual environment

Install Virtualenv (if not already installed):

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
```

```shell
pip install virtualenv
```

Create and activate a virtual environment

```shell
python3 -m venv toraxvenv
source toraxvenv/bin/activate
```

#### Install from PyPI

The simplest way to use TORAX is to install it via PyPI:

```shell
pip install torax
```

You can check that everything runs as it should:

```shell
run_torax --config=examples/basic_config.py --quit
```

If you plan to help develop TORAX, you will need to clone the repository, see
[contributing](https://torax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) and
[contribution_tips](https://torax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_tips.html#contribution-tips)

### Running an example

The following command will run TORAX using the default configuration file
`examples/basic_config.py`.

```shell
run_torax --config='examples/basic_config.py'
```

Simulation progress is shown by a terminal progress bar indicating the current
time and percentage completed.

To run more involved, ITER-inspired simulations, run:

```shell
run_torax --config='examples/iterhybrid_rampup.py'
```

and

```shell
run_torax --config='examples/iterhybrid_predictor_corrector.py'
```

Additional configuration is provided through flags which append the above
run command, and environment variables. For example, for increased output
verbosity, you can run with the `--log_progress` flag.

```shell
run_torax  --config='examples/iterhybrid_rampup.py' --log_progress
```

#### Set environment variables

##### Error checking

If true, error checking is enabled in internal routines. Used for debugging.
Default is false since it is incompatible with the persistent compilation cache.

```shell
$ export TORAX_ERRORS_ENABLED=<True/False>
```

##### JAX Compilation and Cache

If false, JAX does not compile internal TORAX functions. Used for debugging.
Default is true.

```shell
$ export TORAX_COMPILATION_ENABLED=<True/False>
```

The following implements the JAX persistent cache and will cause jax to store
compiled programs to the filesystem, reducing recompilation time in some cases:

```shell
$ export JAX_COMPILATION_CACHE_DIR=<path of your choice, such as ~/jax_cache>
$ export JAX_PERSISTENT_CACHE_MIN_ENTRY_SIZE_BYTES=-1
$ export JAX_PERSISTENT_CACHE_MIN_COMPILE_TIME_SECS=0.0
```

#### Set flags
`log_progress` - output simulation time, dt, and number of solver iterations
(dt backtracking with nonlinear solver) carried out at each timestep.

```shell
run_torax \
   --config=examples/iterhybrid_predictor_corrector.py \
   --log_progress
```

`output_dir` - overrides the default output directory

```shell
run_torax \
   --config=examples/iterhybrid_predictor_corrector.py \
   --output_dir=/path/to/output/dir
```

### Post-simulation

Once complete, the time history of a simulation state and derived quantities
is written to a timestamped file of the format `state_history_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.nc`.
The output directory is user configurable, with a default `/tmp/torax_results`.

To take advantage of the in-memory (non-persistent) cache, the process does not
end upon simulation termination. It is possible to modify the runtime_params,
toggle the `log_progress` and `plot_progress` flags, and rerun the simulation.
The following modifications are examples which will trigger a recompilation:

- Grid resolution
- Evolved variables (equations being solved)
- Changing internal functions used, e.g. transport models, time_step_calculator.
  source models, solver model, pedestal model

### Cleaning up

You can exit the Python virtual env by deactivating it:

```shell
deactivate
```

#### (Optional) Install QLKNN-hyper

The default transport model in TORAX is QLKNN_7_11, installed as a TORAX
dependency. An alternative to QLKNN_7_11 is to use QLKNN-hyper-10D, also known
as QLKNN10D [K.L. van de Plassche PoP 2020](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5134126).
QLKNN_7_11 is based on QuaLiKiz 2.8.1 which has an improved collision
operator compared to the QLKNN10D training set. QLKNN_7_11 training data
includes impurity density gradients as an input feature and has better coverage
of the near-LCFS region compared to QLKNN-hyper-10D. However, using QLKNN10D may
still be useful for specific use-cases, such as in benchmarks with other
simulators, or comparisons with QLKNN_7_11.

Download QLKNN-hyper dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/qualikiz-group/qlknn-hyper.git
```

To use QLKNN10D, set `model_path` in the `transport` section of your TORAX
config to the path of the cloned repository.
