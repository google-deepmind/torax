  State variables in the solver are scaled for solver numerical conditioning.
  i.e., the solver methods find the zero of a residual, minimizes a loss, and/or
  invert a linear system with respect to the state vector x, which is a
  concetenated vector of the x_tuple values. It is important that the solution
  state vector elements are of similar order of magnitude such that e.g. scalars
  related to residual or loss minimizations have similar contributions from the
  various state vector components.
