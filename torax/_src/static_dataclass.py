"""The StaticDataclass class.

This is a base class to be used to define classes to be used as static
arguments to jitted JAX functions. Ideally, all classes in TORAX used as
static arguments should inherit from this class. Static arguments need
to be immutable and need to support comparison and hashing by value in
a way that works with the persistent cache. This process has many
"footguns" and this class has been designed to help avoid them.

  """Empty base class used to define static arguments to JAX.

  This class and its subclasses are to be used as static arguments to jitted
  JAX functions. Specifically, inheriting from this class ensures that a
  new class will be immutable and support comparison and hashing by
  value.

  Subclass responsibilities:
  - (This will cause silent wrong computations if the wrong thing is done) The
    __hash__ method here assumes that the fields of this class and any
   subclasses are immutable and support comparison and hashing by value. If a
   subclass needs to introduce special fields (that shouldn't be hashed, or
   be hashed with a special procedure) the subclass must implement its own
   __hash__ method. For example, the subclass should not have a Python
   function as a field, unless the subclass implements its own __hash__
   function that has some way of correctly hashing that field.
   Implementing a custom hashing strategy also requires overriding
   __post_init__ to turn off the checks that the default strategy is in use.
   While StaticDataclass does its best to automatically detect and prevent
   problems, this is impossible to do in the general case; you must still
   think about how your class should be hashed.
  - (This will be automatically detected if not done) The subclass must also
   be decorated with @dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True,eq=False)
