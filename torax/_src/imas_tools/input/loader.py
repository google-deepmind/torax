  It can load either an IMAS netCDF file with filename as uri and given
  directory or from an IMASdb by giving the full uri of the IDS and the
  directory arg will be ignored. Note that loading from an IMASdb requires
  IMAS-core. The loaded IDS can then be used as input to
  core_profiles_from_IMAS().

  Args:
    uri: Path to netCDF file or full uri of the IDS (this requires IMAS-core).
    ids_name: The name of the IDS to load.
    directory: The directory of the IDS to load.
    explicit_convert: Whether to explicitly convert the IDS to the current DD
      version. If True, an explicit conversion will be attempted. Explicit
      conversion is recommended when converting between major DD versions.
