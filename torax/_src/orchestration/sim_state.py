  """Full simulator state.

  The simulation stepping in sim.py evolves core_profiles which includes all
  the attributes the simulation is advancing. But beyond those, there are
  additional stateful elements which may evolve on each simulation step, such
  as sources and transport.

  This class includes both core_profiles and these additional elements.

  Attributes:
    t: time coordinate.
    dt: timestep interval.
    core_profiles: Core plasma profiles at time t.
    core_transport: Core plasma transport coefficients computed at time t.
    core_sources: Profiles for all sources/sinks. These are the profiles that
      are used to calculate the coefficients for the t+dt time step. For the
      explicit sources, these are calculated at the start of the time step, so
      are the values at time t. For the implicit sources, these are the most
      recent guess for time t+dt. The profiles here are the merged version of
      the explicit and implicit profiles.
    geometry: Geometry at this time step used for the simulation.
    solver_numeric_outputs: Numerical quantities related to the solver.
