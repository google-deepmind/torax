  """Runs one time step of a Newton-Raphson based root-finding on the equation defined by `coeffs`.

  This solver is relatively generic in that it models diffusion, convection,
  etc. abstractly. The caller must do the problem-specific physics calculations
  to obtain the coefficients for a particular problem.

  This solver uses iterative root finding on the linearized residual
  between two sides of the equation describing a theta method update.

  The linearized residual for a trial x_new is:

  R(x_old) + jacobian(R(x_old))*(x_new - x_old)

  Setting delta = x_new - x_old, we solve the linear system:

  A*x_new = b, with A = jacobian(R(x_old)), b = A*x_old - R(x_old)

  Each successive iteration sets x_new = x_old - delta, until the residual
  or delta is under a tolerance (tol).
  If either the delta step leads to an unphysical state, represented by NaNs in
  the residual, or if the residual doesn't shrink following the delta step,
  then delta is successively reduced by a delta_reduction_factor.
  If tau = delta_now / delta_original is below a tolerance, then the iterations
  stop. If residual > tol then the function exits with an error flag, producing
  either a warning or recalculation with a lower dt.

  Args:
    dt: Discrete time step.
    runtime_params_t: Runtime parameters for time t.
    runtime_params_t_plus_dt: Runtime parameters for time t + dt.
    geo_t: Geometry at time t.
    geo_t_plus_dt: Geometry at time t + dt.
    x_old: Tuple containing CellVariables for each channel with their values at
      the start of the time step.
    core_profiles_t: Core plasma profiles which contain all available prescribed
      quantities at the start of the time step. This includes evolving boundary
      conditions and prescribed time-dependent profiles that are not being
      evolved by the PDE system.
    core_profiles_t_plus_dt: Core plasma profiles which contain all available
      prescribed quantities at the end of the time step. This includes evolving
      boundary conditions and prescribed time-dependent profiles that are not
      being evolved by the PDE system.
    explicit_source_profiles: Pre-calculated sources implemented as explicit
      sources in the PDE.
    physics_models: Physics models used for the calculations.
    coeffs_callback: Calculates diffusion, convection etc. coefficients given a
      core_profiles. Repeatedly called by the iterative optimizer.
    evolving_names: The names of variables within the core profiles that should
      evolve.
    initial_guess_mode: chooses the initial_guess for the iterative method,
      either x_old or linear step. When taking the linear step, it is also
      recommended to use Pereverzev-Corrigan terms if the transport coefficients
      are stiff, e.g. from QLKNN. This can be set by setting use_pereverzev =
      True in the solver config.
    maxiter: Quit iterating after this many iterations reached.
    tol: Quit iterating after the average absolute value of the residual is <=
      tol.
    coarse_tol: Coarser allowed tolerance for cases when solver develops small
      steps in the vicinity of the solution.
    delta_reduction_factor: Multiply by delta_reduction_factor after each failed
      line search step.
    tau_min: Minimum delta/delta_original allowed before the newton raphson
      routine resets at a lower timestep.
    log_iterations: If true, output diagnostic information from within iteration
      loop.

  Returns:
    x_new: Tuple, with x_new[i] giving channel i of x at the next time step
    solver_numeric_outputs: state_module.SolverNumericOutputs. Iteration and
      error info. For the error, 0 signifies residual < tol at exit, 1 signifies
      residual > tol, steps became small.
