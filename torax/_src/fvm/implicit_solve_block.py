  """Runs one time step of an implicit solver on the equation defined by `coeffs`.

  This solver is relatively generic in that it models diffusion, convection,
  etc. abstractly. The caller must do the problem-specific physics calculations
  to obtain the coefficients for a particular problem.

  Args:
    dt: Discrete time step.
    x_old: Tuple containing CellVariables for each channel with their values at
    x_new_guess: Tuple containing initial guess for x_new.
    coeffs_old: Coefficients defining the equation, computed for time t.
    coeffs_new: Coefficients defining the equation, computed for time t+dt.
    theta_implicit: Coefficient in [0, 1] determining which solution method to
      use. We solve transient_coeff (x_new - x_old) / dt = theta_implicit
      F(t_new) + (1 - theta_implicit) F(t_old). Three values of theta_implicit
      correspond to named solution methods: theta_implicit = 1: Backward Euler
      implicit method (default). theta_implicit = 0.5: Crank-Nicolson.
      theta_implicit = 0: Forward Euler explicit method
    convection_dirichlet_mode: See docstring of the `convection_terms` function,
      `dirichlet_mode` argument.
    convection_neumann_mode: See docstring of the `convection_terms` function,
      `neumann_mode` argument.

  Returns:
    x_new: Tuple, with x_new[i] giving channel i of x at the next time step
