  """Runs one time step of an optimization-based solver on the equation defined by `coeffs`.

  This solver is relatively generic in that it models diffusion, convection,
  etc. abstractly. The caller must do the problem-specific physics calculations
  to obtain the coefficients for a particular problem.

  This solver uses iterative optimization to minimize the norm of the residual
  between two sides of the equation describing a theta method update.

  Args:
    dt: Discrete time step.
    static_runtime_params_slice: Static runtime parameters. Changes to these
      runtime params will trigger recompilation. A key parameter in this params
      slice is theta_imp, a coefficient in [0, 1] determining which solution
      method to use. We solve transient_coeff (x_new - x_old) / dt = theta_imp
      F(t_new) + (1 - theta_imp) F(t_old). Three values of theta_imp correspond
      to named solution methods: theta_imp = 1: Backward Euler implicit method
      (default). theta_imp = 0.5: Crank-Nicolson. theta_imp = 0: Forward Euler
      explicit method.
    dynamic_runtime_params_slice_t: Runtime params for time t (the start time of
      the step). These runtime params can change from step to step without
      triggering a recompilation.
    dynamic_runtime_params_slice_t_plus_dt: Runtime params for time t + dt.
    geo: Geometry object used to initialize auxiliary outputs.
    x_old: Tuple containing CellVariables for each channel with their values at
      the start of the time step.
    core_profiles_t_plus_dt: Core plasma profiles which contain all available
      prescribed quantities at the end of the time step. This includes evolving
      boundary conditions and prescribed time-dependent profiles that are not
      being evolved by the PDE system.
    transport_model: Turbulent transport model callable.
    explicit_source_profiles: Pre-calculated sources implemented as explicit
      sources in the PDE.
    source_models: Collection of source callables to generate source PDE
      coefficients.
    coeffs_callback: Calculates diffusion, convection etc. coefficients given a
      core_profiles. Repeatedly called by the iterative optimizer.
    evolving_names: The names of variables within the core profiles that should
      evolve.
    initial_guess_mode: Chooses the initial_guess for the iterative method,
      either x_old or linear step. When taking the linear step, it is also
      recommended to use Pereverzev-Corrigan terms if the transport use
      pereverzev terms for linear solver. Is only applied in the nonlinear
      solver for the optional initial guess from the linear solver.
    maxiter: See docstring of `jaxopt.LBFGS`.
    tol: See docstring of `jaxopt.LBFGS`.

  Returns:
    x_new: Tuple, with x_new[i] giving channel i of x at the next time step
    stepper_numeric_outputs: StepperNumericOutputs. Info about iterations and
    errors
    aux_output: Extra auxiliary output from the calc_coeffs.
