  """Runs one time step of an optimization-based solver on the equation defined by `coeffs`.

  This solver is relatively generic in that it models diffusion, convection,
  etc. abstractly. The caller must do the problem-specific physics calculations
  to obtain the coefficients for a particular problem.

  This solver uses iterative optimization to minimize the norm of the residual
  between two sides of the equation describing a theta method update.

  Args:
    x_old: Tuple containing CellVariables for each channel with their values at
      the start of the time step.
    state_t_plus_dt: Sim state which contains all available prescribed
      quantities at the end of the time step. This includes evolving boundary
      conditions and prescribed time-dependent profiles that are not being
      evolved by the PDE system.
    evolving_names: The names of variables within the state that should evolve.
    dt: Discrete time step.
    coeffs_callback: Calculates diffusion, convection etc. coefficients given a
      state. Repeatedly called by the iterative optimizer.
    dynamic_config_slice_t: Runtime configuration for time t (the start time of
      the step). These config params can change from step to step without
      triggering a recompilation.
    dynamic_config_slice_t_plus_dt: Runtime configuration for time t + dt.
    static_config_slice: Static runtime configuration. Changes to these config
      params will trigger recompilation. A key parameter in static_config slice
      is theta_imp, a coefficient in [0, 1] determining which solution method
      to use. We solve transient_coeff (x_new - x_old) / dt = theta_imp F(t_new)
      + (1 - theta_imp) F(t_old). Three values of theta_imp correspond to named
      solution methods: theta_imp = 1: Backward Euler implicit method (default).
      theta_imp = 0.5: Crank-Nicolson. theta_imp = 0: Forward Euler explicit
      method.
    geo: Geometry object used to initialize auxiliary outputs.
    transport_model: Turbulent transport model callable.
    sources: Collection of source callables to generate source PDE coefficients
    explicit_source_profiles: Pre-calculated sources implemented as explicit
      sources in the PDE.
    initial_guess_mode: Chooses the initial_guess for the iterative method,
      either x_old or linear step. When taking the linear step, it is also
      recommended to use Pereverzev-Corrigan terms if the transport use
      pereverzev terms for linear solver. Is only applied in the nonlinear
      solver for the optional initial guess from the linear solver.
    maxiter: See docstring of `jaxopt.LBFGS`.
    tol: See docstring of `jaxopt.LBFGS`.

  Returns:
    x_new: Tuple, with x_new[i] giving channel i of x at the next time step
    error: int. 0 signifies loss < tol at exit, 1 signifies loss > tol
    aux_output: Extra auxiliary output from the calc_coeffs.
