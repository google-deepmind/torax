"""Functionality for fine-grained versioning of torax.

Contains `torax_hash` and the functionality to calculate it.
`torax_hash` should be used in the __hash__ and __eq__ method of all classes
used as arguments to jitted Jax functions.
This ensures that changes to Torax itself cause new code with the new
Torax behavior to be compiled and executed, rather than old cached code with
the old behavior to be executed.
