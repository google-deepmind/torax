"""Inputs to TORAX steppers and functions based on the input runtime parameters.

When running a TORAX simulation, the stepper is (by default) a JAX-compiled
function, meaning it has two types of arguments: "dynamic" and "static".

The "dynamic" arguments can change from call to call. These arguments must be
arrays, scalars, or standard (possibly nested) Python containers. See the JAX
docs for more info on allowed types. They cannot influence the logical branches
the SimulationStepFn may take (again, see the sharp bits in the JAX docs to
learn more about the how these "dynamic" args can be used within the function).

Note that the "dynamic" arguments are NOT necessarily time-dependent. They do
not need to vary from time step to time step (though they can). They can change
from time step to time step, or from simulation run to simulation run, without
triggering a recompile. Changing these params without needing to recompile the
stepper is the defining quality of the dynamic arguments.

The "static" arguments are compile-time constant. Any changes to them would
trigger a recompilation of the stepper. These arguments don't have the same
restrictions as the dynamic arguments both in terms of types and how they are
used.

  """Input params that are ok to use as inputs to a JAX-compiled function.

  This PyTree of params is input to the sim.SimulationStepFn, which updates
  the joint state and evolves the mesh state. This config includes various
  "dynamic" parameters which can change from step to step, or from
  simulation run to simulation run, without requiring components in the
  SimulationStepFn to recompile.

  Note that "dynamic" does NOT mean time dependent necessarily (though these
  params can be time dependent). Here "dynamic" means these params can change
  without trigerring or requiring a recompile.

  While the parameters are not necessarily time-dependent, that is how the class
  gets its name: a config "slice" refers to a subset of the overall TORAX config
  at a specific time t.

  This class contains "slices" of various RuntimeParams attributes defined
  throughout TORAX:

  - from the "general" runtime params
  - from the transport model's runtime params
  - from the stepper's runtime params
  - from each of the sources' runtime params

  This class packages all these together for convenience, as it simplifies many
  of the internal APIs within TORAX.
