The TORAX default CHEASE geometry file corresponds to a ITER hybrid scenario
CRONOS simulation presented in J. Citrin et al 2010 Nucl. Fusion 50 115007.

ITER_hybrid_citrin_equil_cheasedata.mat2cols

The following EQDSK output file was generated based on this CHEASE geometry:
eqdsk_cocos02.eqdsk

This EQDSK geometry was used to verify the TORAX EQDSK geometry converter/

The IMAS netCDF file ITERhybrid_rampup_11_time_slices_COCOS17_IDS_ddv4.nc was generated
by extracting p' and ff' profiles for each timeslice from a TORAX simulation with the
iterhybrid_rampup.py config, and passing the profiles in to CHEASE.
The LCFS was kept fixed for all timeslices, using the values from
ITER_hybrid_citrin_equil_cheasedata.mat2cols.
