## Scenarios

### ITER hybrid scenarios

This scenario corresponds to an ITER hybrid scenario simulated in CRONOS,
as presented in J. Citrin et al 2010 Nucl. Fusion 50 115007.
The equilibria were generated using [CHEASE](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/spc/chease).
The canonical source of truth for this data is [here](https://gitlab.com/qualikiz-group/pyntegrated_model/-/tree/4a3656ffbcb92ab166f255d9f62d8722cb15d5fd/geo).

The mat2cols file is [`pyntegrated_model/geo/ITER_hybrid_citrin_equil_cheasedata.mat2cols`](https://gitlab.com/qualikiz-group/pyntegrated_model/-/blob/4a3656ffbcb92ab166f255d9f62d8722cb15d5fd/geo/ITER_hybrid_citrin_equil_cheasedata.mat2cols).

The EQDSK files were generated from [`pyntegrated_model/geo/EQDSK_ITERhybrid_COCOS02`](https://gitlab.com/qualikiz-group/pyntegrated_model/-/blob/4a3656ffbcb92ab166f255d9f62d8722cb15d5fd/geo/EQDSK_ITERhybrid_COCOS02) as follows:

```
# Download
wget https://gitlab.com/qualikiz-group/pyntegrated_model/-/raw/main/geo/EQDSK_ITERhybrid_COCOS02

# Convert to COCOS11 using CHEASE functions
# This produces two output files, EQDSK_ITERhybrid_COCOS11 and EQDSK_ITERhybrid_COCOS11_IpB0positive
matlab -nodisplay
>> addpath(genpath('chease'));
>> eqdsk_cocos02 = read_eqdsk('EQDSK_ITERhybrid_COCOS02', 2);
>> [eqdsk_cocos11] = eqdsk_cocos_transform(eqdsk_cocos02, [2, 11]);
>> write_eqdsk('EQDSK_ITERhybrid', eqdsk_cocos11, [11]);
>> exit

rm EQDSK_ITERhybrid_COCOS11
mv EQDSK_ITERhybrid_COCOS11_IpB0positive iterhybrid_cocos11.eqdsk
mv EQDSK_ITERhybrid_COCOS02 iterhybrid_cocos02.eqdsk
```

You may also need to manually strip off the comment block at the end of the file (this will be fixed in future releases of the eqdsk package).
