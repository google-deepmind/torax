The IMAS netCDF file core_profiles_ddv4_iterhybrid_rampup_conditions.nc was 
generated manually filling the core_profiles IDS based on the 
profile_conditions contained in the iterhybrid_rampup.py example config (after
unit conversions).\
The file core_profiles_15MA_DT_50_50_flat_top_slice.nc comes from a METIS ITER
baseline scenario time slice taken on the flat top. The IDS grid is made of 21
points.
