How to contribute
=================

We'd love to accept your contributions to this project. There are multiple ways
to contribute:

* Answering questions on TORAX's `[discussions page]. <https://github.com/google-deepmind/torax/discussions>`_
* Improving TORAX's `[documentation]. <https://torax.readthedocs.io>`_
* Contributing to TORAX's core `[code-base]. <https://github.com/google-deepmind/torax>`_

A wide variety of contributions are welcome. See the :ref:`roadmap` for prioritized projects. In particular, TORAX is envisaged
as a natural framework for coupling of various ML-surrogates of physics models. These could include surrogates for turbulent
transport, neoclassical transport, heat and particle sources, line radiation, pedestal physics, and core-edge integration,
MHD, among others.
