How to contribute
=================

We'd love to accept your contributions to this project. There are multiple ways
to contribute:

* Answering questions on TORAX's `[discussions page]. <https://github.com/google-deepmind/torax/discussions>`_
* Improving TORAX's `[documentation]. <https://torax.readthedocs.io>`_
* Contributing to TORAX's core `[code-base]. <https://github.com/google-deepmind/torax>`_

A wide variety of contributions are welcome. See the :ref:`roadmap` for
prioritized projects. In particular, TORAX is envisaged as a natural framework
for coupling of various ML-surrogates of physics models. These could include
surrogates for turbulent transport, neoclassical transport, heat and particle
sources, line radiation, pedestal physics, and core-edge integration,
MHD, among others. Before making major contributions please begin a discussion
on the repo to ensure that the feature is not already in development, and to
discuss ideas and design before starting work.

See :ref:`contribution_tips` for more guidance on installation, code review,
documentation, and testing.
