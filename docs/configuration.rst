Simulation input configuration
##############################

Jump to :ref:`config_details` for an immediate overview of all configuration parameters.

General notes
=============

TORAX's configuration system allows for fine-grained control over various aspects of the simulation.
The top layer ``config`` file is passed as input into a simulation, and contains a dictionary with the following keys:

* **runtime_params**. Dictionary containing nested dictionaries describing the following sets of simulation parameters.

  * **plasma_composition**: Configures the distribution of ion species.
  * **profile_conditions**: Configures boundary conditions, initial conditions, and prescribed time-dependence of temperature, density, and current.
  * **numerics**: Configures time stepping settings and numerical parameters.
  * **output_dir**: Selects the output directory.

* **geometry**: Configures geometry setup and constructs the Geometry object.
* **transport**: Selects and configures the transport model, and constructs the TransportModel object.
* **sources**: Selects and configures parameters of the various heat source, particle source, and non-inductive current models.
* **stepper**: Selects and configures the PDE solver.
* **time_step_calculator**: Selects the method used to calculate the timestep `dt`.

This configuration structure maps to objects instantiated and manipulated within TORAX.
See :ref:`structure` for more information on TORAX simulation objects.
Further details on the internals of the configuration data structures are found in :ref:`config_details`.

For various definitions, see :ref:`glossary`.

Time dependence and parameter interpolation
===========================================
Some TORAX parameters are allowed to temporally vary. Parameters where time dependence is enabled are
are labelled with **time-varying-scalar** and **time-varying-array** in :ref:`config_details`.

Time-varying scalars
--------------------
For fields labelled with **time-varying-scalar** time dependence is set by assigning a dict to the parameter,
instead of a single value. The dict defines a time-series with ``{time: value}`` pairs.
The keys do not need to be sorted in order of time. Ordering is carried out internally.
For each evaluation of the TORAX stepper (PDE solver), time-dependent variables
are interpolated at both time :math:`t` and time :math:`t+dt`.
There are two interpolation modes:

* **PIECEWISE_LINEAR**: linear interpolation of the input time-series (default)
* **STEP**: stepwise change in values following each traversal above a time value in the time-series.

The following inputs are valid for **time-varying-scalar** parameters:

* Single integer, float, or boolean. The parameter is then not time dependent
* A time-series dict with ``{time: value}`` pairs, using the default ``interpolation_mode='PIECEWISE_LINEAR'``.
* A tuple with ``(time-series, value-series)``. The time-series is a 1D array of times, and the value-series is a 1D array of values and the dimensions of both must match.
* A ``xarray.DataArray`` with a single coordinate and a 1D value array.

Examples:

1. Define a time-dependent :math:`Z_{eff}` with piecewise linear interpolation, from :math:`t=2` to :math:`t=15`.
:math:`Z_{eff}` drops from 2.8 to 1.5, and then stays flat.

.. code-block:: python

  Zeff = ({2: 2.8, 5: 2.0, 8: 1.5, 15: 1.5}, 'PIECEWISE_LINEAR')

or more simply, taking advantage of the default.

.. code-block:: python

  Zeff = {2: 2.8, 5: 2.0, 8: 1.5, 15: 1.5}

2. Define a time dependent internal boundary condition for ion temperature, ``Tiped``, with stepwise changes,
starting at :math:`1~keV`` at :math:`t=2s`, transitioning to :math:`3~keV`` at :math:`t=8s`, and back down
to :math:`1~keV` at :math:`t=20s`:

.. code-block:: python

  Tiped= ({2: 1.0, 8: 3.0, 20: 1.0}, 'STEP')

To extend configuration parameters where time-dependence is not enabled, to have time-dependence, see :ref:`developer-guides`.

Time-varying arrays
-------------------
Time-varying arrays can be defined using either primitives, an
``xarray.DataArray`` or a ``dict`` of ``Array``.

Using primitives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For fields labelled with **time-varying-array** time dependence is set by assigning a dict of dicts to the parameter.

The outer dict defines a time-series with ``{time: value}`` pairs.
The ``value`` itself is interpreted as a radial profile, being made up of {rho: value} pairs.
It behaves similarly to the **time-varying-scalar** but any interpolation will happen along the
:math:`\hat{\rho}` axis and can take any of the formats defined for a **time-varying-scalar** above.

Note: :math:`\hat{\rho}` is normalized and will take values between 0 and 1.

None of the keys need to be sorted in order of time. Ordering is carried out internally.
In the case of non-evolving parameters for each evaluation of the TORAX stepper (PDE solver), time-dependent variables
are interpolated first along the :math:`\hat{\rho}` axis at the cell grid centers and then linearly interpolated in time
at both time :math:`t` and time :math:`t+dt`..

For :math:`t` greater than or less than the largest or smallest defined time then the interpolation scheme
will be applied from the closest time value.

Shortcuts:

Passing a single float value is interpreted as defining a constant profile for all times.
For example ``Ti: 6.0`` would be equivalent to passing in ``Ti: {0.0: {0.0: 6.0}}``.

Passing a single dict (instead of dict of dicts) is a shortcut for defining the rho profile
for :math:`t=0.0`. For example ``Ti: {0.0: 18.0, 0.95: 5.0, 1.0: 0.2}`` is a shortcut for
``Ti: {0.0: {0: 18.0, 0.95: 5.0, 1.0: 0.2}}`` where :math:`t=0.0` is arbitrary
(due to constant extrapolation for any input :math:`t=0.0`).


Examples:

1. Define an initial profile (at :math:`t=0.0`) for :math:`T_{i}` with a pedestal.

.. code-block:: python

  Ti = {0.0: {0.0: 15.0, 0.95: 3.0, 1.0: 1.0}}

Note: due to constant extrapolation the t=0.0 here is an arbitrary number and could be anything.

2. Define a time-dependent :math:`T_{i}` profile initialised with a pedestal and, if the ion equation is not being
evolved by the PDE, to have a prescribed time evolution which decays to a
constant :math:`T_{i}=1` by :math:`t=80.0`.

.. code-block:: python

  Ti = {0.0: {0.0: 15.0, 0.95: 3.0, 1.0: 1.0}, 80: 1.0}

Using ``xarray.DataArray``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a ``xarray.DataArray`` is specified then it is expected to have a
``time`` and ``rho_norm`` coordinate. The values of the data array are the values
at each time and rho_norm.

Using ``dict`` of ``Array``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a ``dict`` of ``Array`` is used, the dict must have keys of ``time``,
``rho_norm`` and ``value``.

``time`` and ``rho_norm`` are expected to map to 1D array values.
``value`` is expected to map to a 2D array with shape ``(len(time), len(rho_norm))``.

.. _config_details:

Detailed configuration structure
================================

Data types and default values are written in parentheses. Any declared parameter in a run-specific config, overrides the default value.

runtime_params
--------------

plasma_composition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defines the distribution of ion species. Currently restricted to a single main ion, a single impurity and a flat :math:`Z_{eff}`.

``Ai`` (float = 2.5)
  Mass of main ion in amu units. For multiple-isotope plasmas, make an effective average.

``Zi`` (float = 1.0):
  Charge of main ion in units of electron charge.

``Zimp`` (float = 10.0), **time-varying-scalar**

  Plasma effective charge, defined as :math:`Z_{eff}=\sum_i Z_i^2 \hat{n}_i`, where :math:`\hat{n}_i` is
  the normalized ion density :math:`n_i/n_e`. For a given :math:`Z_{eff}` and :math:`Z_{imp}`, a consistent :math:`\hat{n}_i` is calculated,
  with the appropriate degree of main ion dilution.

Profile conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configures boundary conditions, initial conditions, and prescribed time-dependence of temperature, density, and current.

``Ti_bound_right`` (float | None [default]), **time-varying-scalar**
  Ion temperature boundary condition at :math:`\hat{\rho}=1` in units of keV.
  If not provided or set to `None` then the boundary condition is taken from the

``Te_bound_right`` (float | None [default]), **time-varying-scalar**
  Electron temperature boundary condition at :math:`\hat{\rho}=1`, in units of keV.

  Note: For a given time ``t``, ``Ti[t]`` is used to define interpolation along :math:`\hat{\rho}` at cell centers.
  If `Ti_bound_right=None`, the boundary condition at :math:`\hat{\rho}=1`
  is taken from the :math:`\hat{\rho}=1` value derived from the provided `Ti` profile.
  Note that if the `Ti` profile does not contain a :math:`\hat{\rho}=1` point
  for all provided times, an error will be raised.

``Te`` (dict = {0: {0: 15.0, 1: 1.0}}), **time-varying-array**
  Initial and (if not time evolving) prescribed :math:`\hat{\rho}` electron temperature, in units of keV.

  Note: For a given time ``t``, ``Te[t]`` is used to define interpolation along :math:`\hat{\rho}` at cell centers.
  If `Te_bound_right=None`, the boundary condition at :math:`\hat{\rho}=1`
  is taken from the :math:`\hat{\rho}=1` value derived from the provided `Te` profile.

  or the "nu formula".


``ne`` (dict = {0: {0: 1.5, 1: 1.0}}), **time-varying-array**

  If ``dens_eq==True`` (see :ref:`numerics_dataclass`), then time dependent ``ne`` is ignored, and only the initial value is used.

  If ``ne_bound_right=None``, the boundary condition at :math:`\hat{\rho}=1`
  is taken from the :math:`\hat{\rho}=1` value derived from the provided ``ne`` profile.
  Note that if the ``ne`` profile does not contain a :math:`\hat{\rho}=1` point
  for all provided times, an error will be raised.

``normalize_to_nbar`` (bool = True)
  If True, then the electron density profile is normalized to have the desired line averaged density
  :math:`\bar{n}`.

``nbar`` (float = 0.5), **time-varying-scalar**
  Line averaged density. In units of reference density ``nref`` (see :ref:`numerics_dataclass`) if ``ne_is_fGW==False``.
  In units of Greenwald fraction :math:`n_{GW}` if ``ne_is_fGW==True``. :math:`n_{GW}=I_p/(\pi a^2)` in units of :math:`10^{20} m^{-3}`, where :math:`a`

``ne_is_fGW`` (bool = True)
  Toggles units of ``nbar``.

  If not provided or set to `None` then the boundary condition is taken from the
  :math:`\hat{\rho}=1` value derived from the provided `ne` profile.

``ne_bound_right_is_fGW`` (bool = False)
  Toggles units of ``ne_bound_right``.

``set_pedestal`` (bool = True), **time-varying-scalar**
  Set internal boundary conditions if True. Do not set internal boundary conditions if False.
  Internal boundary conditions are set using an adaptive localized source term. While a common use-case is to mock up a pedestal, this feature
  can also be used for L-mode modeling with a desired internal boundary condition below :math:`\hat{\rho}=1`.

``Tiped`` (float = 5.0), **time-varying-scalar**
  Internal boundary condition for ion temperature at :math:`\hat{\rho}` = ``Ped_top``, in units of keV.

``neped`` (float = 0.7), **time-varying-scalar**
  Internal boundary condition for electron density at  :math:`\hat{\rho}` = ``Ped_top``, in units of keV.

``neped_is_fGW`` (bool = False)
  Toggles units of ``neped``.

``Ped_top`` (float = 0.91), **time-varying-scalar**
  Location of internal boundary condition, in units of :math:`\hat{\rho}`. In practice, the closest cell
  gridpoint to ``Ped_top`` will be used.

``nu`` (float = 3.0)
  Peaking coefficient of initial current profile: :math:`j = j_0(1 - \hat{\rho}^2)^\nu`. :math:`j_0` is calculated
  to be consistent with a desired total current. Only used if ``initial_psi_from_j==True``, otherwise the ``psi`` profile from the geometry file is used.

``initial_j_is_total_current`` (bool = False)
  Toggles the interpretation of :math:`j` above. If true, then :math:`j` is the total current.
  If false, then :math:`j` is Ohmic current, with :math:`I_{ohm} = I_{tot} - I_{ni}`, where :math:`I_{ni}` is the total non-inductive current
  calculated upon initialization.

``initial_psi_from_j`` (bool = False)
  Toggles if the initial ``psi`` (:math:`\psi`) calculation is based on the "nu" current formula, or from the ``psi``
  available in the numerical geometry file. This setting is ignored for the ad-hoc circular geometry option, which has no numerical geometry, and thus the
  initial ``psi`` is always calculated from the "nu" current formula.

numerics
^^^^^^^^

Configures simulation control such as time settings and timestep calculation, equations being solved, constant numerical variables.

``t_initial`` (float = 0.0)

``dtmult`` (float = 9.0)
  Prefactor in front of ``chi_timestep_calculator`` base timestep :math:`dt_{base}=\frac{dx^2}{2\chi}` (see :ref:`time_step_calculator`).

``enable_prescribed_profile_evolution`` (bool = True)
  Enable time-dependent prescribed profiles. If False, then time-dependent ``numerics``
  quantities such as ``nbar`` and ``Ti`` will be ignored, even if their respective core_profile equation is not being solved by the PDE.
  This option is provided to allow initialization of density profiles scaled to a Greenwald fraction, and freeze this density even if the current
  is time evolving. Otherwise the density will evolve to always maintain that GW fraction.

``q_correction_factor`` (float = 1.38)
  q-profile correction factor used only in the ad-hoc circular geometry model

``resistivity_mult`` (float = 1.0)

  with ``nrho_hires = nrho * hi_res_fac``, used for ``j`` to ``psi`` conversions.

For setting up time-dependent geometry, a subset of varying geometry parameters
and input files are defined in a ``geometry_configs`` dict, which is a
time-series of {time: {configs}} pairs. For example, a time-dependent geometry
input with 3 time-slices of FBT geometries can be set up as:

.. code-block:: python

  'geometry': {
      'geometry_type': 'fbt',
      'Ip_from_parameters': True,
      'geometry_configs': {
          20.0: {
              'LY_file': 'LY_early_rampup.mat',
              'L_file': 'L_early_rampup.mat',
              'Rmaj': 6.2,
              'Rmin': 2.0,

              'Rmin': 2.0,
              'B0': 5,3,
          },
      },
  },

All file loading and geometry processing is done upon simulation initialization.
The geometry inputs into the TORAX PDE coefficients are then time-interpolated
on-the-fly onto the TORAX time slices where the PDE calculations are done.

  If True, use either :math:`D_{eff}` or :math:`V_{eff}` for particle transport. See :ref:`physics_models` for more details.

``An_min`` (float = 0.05)
  :math:`|R/L_{ne}|` value below which :math:`V_{eff}` is used instead of :math:`D_{eff}`, if ``DVeff==True``.

``avoid_big_negative_s`` (bool = True)
  If True, modify input magnetic shear such that :math:`\hat{s} - \alpha_{MHD} > -0.2` always,
  to compensate for the lack of slab ITG modes in QuaLiKiz.

``smag_alpha_correction`` (bool = True)
  If True, reduce input magnetic shear by :math:`0.5*\alpha_{MHD}` to capture the main impact of
  :math:`\alpha_{MHD}`, which was not itself part of the QLKNN10D training set.

``q_sawtooth_proxy`` (bool = True)
  To avoid un-physical transport barriers, modify the input q-profile and magnetic shear for zones where
  :math:`q < 1`, as a proxy for sawteeth. Where :math:`q<1`, then the :math:`q` and :math:`\hat{s}` QLKNN10D inputs are clipped to
  :math:`q=1` and :math:`\hat{s}=0.1`.

sources
-------

dict with nested dicts containing the runtime parameters of all TORAX heat, particle, and current sources. The following runtime parameters
are common to all sources, with defaults depending on the specific source. See :ref:`physics_models` For details on the source physics models.

Any source which is not explicitly included in the sources dict, is set to zero. To include a source with default
options, the source dict should contain an empty dict. For example, for setting ``qei_source``, with default options,
as the only active source in ``sources``, set:

.. code-block:: python

    'sources': {
        'qei_source': {},
    }

The configurable runtime parameters of each source are as follows:

``mode`` (str)
  Defines how the source values are computed. Currently the options are:

* ``'ZERO'``
    Source is set to zero.

* ``'MODEL'``
    Source values come from a model in code. Specific model selection is not yet available in TORAX since there are no source components with more than one
    physics model. However, this will be straightforward to develop when that occurs.

* ``'FORMULA'``
    Source values come from a prescribed (possibly time-dependent) formula that is not dependent on the state of the system. The formula type (Gaussian, exponential)
    is set by ``formula_type``.

For example, to set 'fusion_power' to zero, e.g. for testing or sensitivity purposes, set:

.. code-block:: python

    'sources': {
        'fusion_heat_source': {'mode': 'ZERO'},
    }

``is_explicit`` (bool)
  Defines whether the source is to be considered explicit or implicit. Explicit sources are calculated based on the simulation state at the
  beginning of a time step, or do not have any dependance on state. Implicit sources depend on updated states as the iterative solvers evolve the state through the
  course of a time step. If a source model is complex but evolves over slow timescales compared to the state, it may be beneficial to set it as explicit.

``formula_type`` (str='default')
  Sets the formula type if ``mode=='formula'``. The current options are:

* ``'exponential'`` takes the following arguments:
  * c1 (float): Offset location
  * c2 (float): Exponential decay parameter
  * total (float): integral
  * use_normalized_r (bool = False)

  The profile is parameterized as follows :math:`Q = C e^{-(r - c1) / c2}` , where ``C`` is calculated to be consistent with ``total``. If ``use_normalized_r==True``,
  then c1 and c2 are interpreted as being in normalized toroidal flux units.

* ``'gaussian'`` takes the following arguments:
  * c1 (float): Gaussian peak Location
  * c2 (float): Gaussian width
  * total (float): integral
  * use_normalized_r (bool = False)

  The profile is parameterized as follows :math:`Q = C e^{-((r - c1)^2) / (2 c2^2)}` , where ``C`` is calculated to be consistent with ``total``. If ``use_normalized_r==True``,
  then c1 and c2 are interpreted as being in normalized toroidal flux units.

* ``'default'``
    Some sources have default implementations which use the above formulas under the hood with intuitive parameter names for c1 and c2.
    Consult the list below for further details.

stepper
-------

Select and configure the ``Stepper`` object, which evolves the PDE system by one timestep. See :ref:`solver_details` for further details.
The dictionary consists of keys common to all steppers, and additional nested dictionaries where parameters pertaining to a specific stepper are defined.

``stepper_type`` (str = 'linear')
  Selected PDE solver algorithm. The current options are:

* ``'linear'``
    Linear solver where PDE coefficients are set at fixed values of the state. An approximation of the nonlinear solution is optionally
    carried out with a predictor-corrector method, i.e. fixed point iteration of the PDE coefficients.

* ``'newton_raphson'``
    Nonlinear solver using the Newton-Raphson iterative algorithm, with backtracking line search, and timestep backtracking,
    for increased robustness.

* ``'optimizer'``
    Nonlinear solver using the jaxopt library.

``theta_imp`` (float = 1.0)
  theta value in the theta method of time discretization. 0 = explicit, 1 = fully implicit, 0.5 = Crank-Nicolson.

``adaptive_dt`` (bool = True)
  If true, then turns on dt backtracking, where dt is iteratively reduced by ``dt_reduction_factor`` in a new attempt step
  if the stepper does not converge. Only relevant for nonlinear steppers.

``dt_reduction_factor`` (float = 3.0)
  dt reduction factor if the stepper does not converge following a call, and ``adaptive_dt=True``. Only relevant
  for nonlinear steppers.

``predictor_corrector`` (bool = True)
  Enables predictor_corrector iterations with the linear solver.

``corrector_steps`` (int = 1)
  Number of corrector steps for the predictor-corrector linear solver. 0 means a pure linear solve with no corrector steps.

``use_pereverzev`` (bool = False)
  Use Pereverzev-Corrigan terms in the heat and particle flux when using the linear solver.
  Critical for stable calculation of stiff transport, at the cost of introducing non-physical lag during transient. Also used for
  the ``linear_step`` initial guess mode in the nonlinear solvers.

``chi_per`` (float = 20.0)
  Large heat conductivity used for the Pereverzev-Corrigan term.

``d_per`` (float = 10.0)
  Large particle diffusion used for the Pereverzev-Corrigan term.

linear
^^^^^^

Runtime parameters relevant for the ``LinearThetaMethod``, e.g. ``predictor_corrector``, are not defined in the child class but in the parent
``Stepper`` class and hence in the upper layer of the ``stepper`` config dict. Since the nonlinear steppers also have the option of using
a linear solver for calculating an initial guess, it is more appropriate for these shared linear runtime parameters to be defined in the
parent ``Stepper`` class.

newton_raphson
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``newton_raphson_params`` dict containing the following configuration parameters for the Newton Raphson stepper.

``log_iterations`` (bool = False)
  Log the internal iterations in the Newton-Raphson solver.

``initial_guess_mode`` (str = 'linear_step')
  Sets the approach taken for the initial guess into the Newton-Raphson solver for the first iteration.
  Two options are available:

* ``x_old``
    Use the state at the beginning of the timestep.

* ``linear_step``
    Use the linear solver to obtain an initial guess to warm-start the nonlinear solver.

``tol`` (float = 1e-5)
  PDE residual magnitude tolerance for successfully exiting the iterative solver.

``coarse_tol`` (float = 1e-2)
  If the solver hits an exit criterion due to small steps or many iterations,
  but the residual is still below ``coarse_tol``, then the step is allowed to successfully pass, and a warning is passed to the user.

``maxiter`` (int = 30)
  Maximum number of allowed Newton iterations. If the number of iterations surpasses ``maxiter``, then the solver will
  exit in an unconverged state.   The step will still be accepted if ``residual < coarse_tol``, otherwise dt backtracking will take place if enabled.

``delta_reduction_factor`` (float = 0.5)
  Reduction of Newton iteration step size in the backtracking line search. If in a given iteration,
  the new state is unphysical (e.g. negative temperatures) or the residual increases in magnitude, then a smaller step will be iteratively taken
  until the above conditions are met.

``tau_min`` (float = 0.01)
  tau is the relative reduction in step size: delta/delta_original, following backtracking line search,
  where delta_original is the step in state :math:`x` that minimizes the linearized PDE system. If following some iterations,
  ``tau`` :math:`<` ``tau_min``, , then the solver will exit in an unconverged state. The step will still be accepted if ``residual < coarse_tol``,
  otherwise dt backtracking will take place if enabled.

optimizer
^^^^^^^^^

``optimizer_params`` dict containing the following configuration parameters for the Optimizer stepper.

``initial_guess_mode`` (str = 'linear_step')
  Sets the approach taken for the initial guess into the Newton-Raphson solver for the first iteration.
  Two options are available:

* ``x_old``
    Use the state at the beginning of the timestep.

* ``linear_step``
    Use the linear solver to obtain an initial guess to warm-start the nonlinear solver.

``tol`` (float = 1e-12)
  PDE loss magnitude tolerance for successfully exiting the iterative solver.

``maxiter`` (int = 100)
  Maximum number of allowed optimizer iterations.

time_step_calculator
--------------------

``time_step_calculator_type`` (str = 'chi')
  The name of the ``time_step_calculator``, a method which calculates ``dt`` at every timestep.
  Two methods are currently available:

* ``'fixed'``
    ``dt`` is equal to ``fixed_dt`` defined in :ref:`numerics_dataclass`. If the Newton-Raphson solver is being used
    and ``adaptive_dt==True``, then in practice some steps may have lower ``dt`` if the solver needed to backtrack.

* ``'chi'``
    adaptive dt method, where ``dt`` is a multiple of a base dt inspired by the explicit stability limit for parabolic PDEs:
    :math:`dt_{base}=\frac{dx^2}{2\chi}`, where :math:`dx` is the grid resolution and :math:`\chi=max(\chi_i, \chi_e)`. ``dt=dtmult * dt_base``, where
    ``dtmult`` is defined in :ref:`numerics_dataclass`, and can be significantly larger than unity for implicit solvers.

Scaling the timestep to be :math:`\propto \chi` helps protect against traversing through fast transients, if there is a desire for them to be fully resolved.


Additional Notes
================

.. _dynamic_vs_static:

Dynamic vs. Static Parameters
-----------------------------

Dynamic parameters: These can be changed without recompiling the simulation code. Examples include time-dependent parameters like heating power or external current.

Static parameters: These define the fundamental structure of the simulation and require JAX recompilation if changed.
Examples include the number of grid points or the choice of transport model. A partial list is provided below.

* ``runtime_params['geometry']['nrho']``
* ``runtime_params['numerics']['ion_heat_eq']``
* ``runtime_params['numerics']['el_heat_eq']``
* ``runtime_params['numerics']['current_eq']``
* ``runtime_params['numerics']['dens_eq']``
* ``transport['transport_model']``
* ``stepper['stepper_type']``
* ``time_step_calculator['time_step_calculator_type']``

In addition, changing any source from ``formula`` to ``model`` mode, or changing any source ``model``, will trigger recompilation. Toggling sources to ``zero``
mode and back, will not trigger recompilation.

hybrid scenario rampup (presently with a fixed CHEASE geometry), is shown below.
