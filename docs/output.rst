Simulation output structure
###########################

TORAX file output is written to a ``state_history.nc`` netCDF file. If running with
the ``run_simulation_main.py`` or ``run_torax`` script, the ``output_dir``
is set via flag ``--output_dir``, with default
``/tmp/torax_results_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>/``.

We currently support the below output structure for Torax V1.

The output is an `[xarray DataTree] <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/generated/xarray.DataTree.html>`_.

The DataTree is a hierarchical structure containing three ``xarray.DataSet``
objects:

* ``numerics`` containing simulation numeric quantities.
* ``scalars`` containing scalar quantities.
* ``profiles`` containing 1D profile quantities.

Where sensible we have aimed to match names used by the IMAS standard.

Also, note that, TORAX does not have a specific COCOS it
adheres to, yet. Our team is working on aligning to a specific standard COCOS
on both the input and output. (CHEASE, which is COCOS 2 is still the supported
way to provide geometric inputs to TORAX, and we will continue to support CHEASE
as an input method, regardless of which COCOS we choose.)

Dimensions
==========

The DataTree/Dataset variables can have the following dimensions:

* (time)
* (time, space)

There are three named variants of spatial dimension:

* **rho_cell_norm**: corresponding to the ``torax.fvm`` cell grid.
* **rho_face_norm**: corresponding to the ``torax.fvm`` face grid.
* **rho_norm**: corresponding to the ``torax.fvm`` cell grid plus boundary values.

See :ref:`fvm` for more details on the grids.

In all subsequent lists, the dimensions associated with each variable or coordinate
will be surrounded by parentheses, e.g. (time, rho_norm).

Coordinates
===========

All the ``Dataset`` objects in the output contains the following Coordinates. In order
for users of TORAX outputs to not have to worry about TORAX internals such as
interpolation routines or the grid on which a value is computed we provide
outputs on three different grids depending on the available data for an output.
Some TORAX outputs are only computed on the face grid (such as transport
coefficients), some only on the cell (such as source profiles) and some are
computed on both (like the core profiles evolved by the PDE).
In cases where both are computed we merge the computed quantities into a single
output on the cell grid as well as the left and right face values. These
different grids exist due to the finite-volume method.

* ``time`` (time)
    Times corresponding to each simulation timestep, in units of [:math:`s`].

* ``rho_norm`` (rho_cell + boundary values)
   Normalized toroidal flux coordinate (see :ref:`glossary`) on the fvm cell grid.
   The array size is set in the input config by ``geometry['nrho']+2``.

* ``rho_cell_norm`` (rho_cell)
    Normalized toroidal flux coordinate (see :ref:`glossary`) on the fvm cell grid.
    The array size is set in the input config by ``geometry['nrho']``.

* ``rho_face_norm`` (rho_face)
    Normalized toroidal flux coordinate (see :ref:`glossary`) on the fvm face grid.
    The array size is ``geometry['nrho']+1``.

The coordinate for a given data variable is then attached to the given variable.

Top level dataset
=================
The top level dataset contains the config used to run the simulation. This can
be used to rerun a simulation with the same input. Otherwise the top level
only has references to the child datasets.

``attrs`` ()
  The ``attrs`` field of a Dataset is used to store metadata about the Dataset
  as a dictionary. We use this field to store the input config as a json string
  under the ``config`` key.

To retrieve the input config, see :ref:`output_examples` below.

Child datatrees
===============
The following datatrees are child nodes, the title of each section is the name of
the child ``DataTree``.

numerics
--------
The ``numerics`` dataset contains the following data variables.

``sim_error`` ()
  Indicator if the simulation completed successfully, 0 if successful, 1 if not.

``sawtooth_crash`` (time)
  Boolean array with a length equal to the number of simulation timesteps,
  indicating whether the state at that timestep corresponds to a
  post-sawtooth-crash state.

  Number of outer solver iterations. This will either be 1 or in the case of
  any adaptive steps being taken, 1+`num_adaptive_steps`

``inner_solver_iterations`` (time)
  Number of inner solver iterations.

profiles
--------

This dataset contains radial profiles of various plasma parameters at different times. The radial coordinate is the normalized toroidal flux coordinate.
Note that the output structure is dependent on the input config for the ``geometry``, ``transport`` and ``sources`` fields.

For ``sources`` certain profiles are only output if the source is active.

Working with output data
========================

To demonstrate xarray and numpy manipulations of output data, the following code carries out
volume integration of ``alpha_e`` and ``alpha_i`` at the time closest to t=1. The result equals
the input config ``sources['fusion']['P_total']`` at the time closest to t=1.

The netCDF file is assumed to be in the working directory.

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np
  from torax import output

  data_tree = output.load_state_file('state_history.nc').sel(time=1.0, method='nearest')
  alpha_electron = data_tree.profiles.alpha_e
  alpha_ion = data_tree.profiles.alpha_i
  vpr = data_tree.profiles.vpr.sel(rho_norm=data_tree.rho_cell_norm)

  P_total = np.trapz((alpha_el + alpha_ion) * vpr, data_tree.rho_cell_norm)


It is possible to retrieve the input config from the output for debugging
purposes or to rerun the simulation.

.. code-block:: python

  import json
  import torax
  from torax import output

  data_tree = output.load_state_file('state_history.nc')
  config_dict = json.loads(data_tree.attrs['config'])
  # Check which transport model was used.
  print(config_dict['transport']['model_name'])
  # We can also use ToraxConfig to run the simulation again.
  torax_config = torax.ToraxConfig.from_dict(config_dict)
  new_output = torax.run_simulation(torax_config)
