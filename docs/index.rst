TORAX: Tokamak transport simulation in JAX
==========================================

TORAX is a differentiable tokamak core transport simulator aimed for fast and
accurate forward modelling, pulse-design, trajectory optimization, and controller
design workflows. TORAX is written in Python using the JAX_ library.

      Python facilitates coupling within various workflows and to additional
      physics models. Easy to install and JAX can seamlessly execute
      on multiple backends including CPU and GPU.

      JAX provides just-in-time compilation for fast runtimes. JAX auto-differentiability
      enables gradient-based nonlinear PDE solvers and simulation sensitivity analysis while
      avoiding the need to manually derive Jacobians.

      ML-surrogate coupling for fast and accurate simulation is greatly facilitated
      by JAX's inherent support for neural network development and inference.
