Installation Guide
##################

Requirements
============

Install Python 3.10 or greater.

Make sure that tkinter is installed:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo apt-get install python3-tk

How to install
==============

.. _prepare_virtualenv:

Prepare a virtual environment
-----------------------------

Install virtualenv (if not already installed):

.. code-block:: console

  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install virtualenv

Create a code directory where you will install the virtual env and other TORAX
dependencies.

.. code-block:: console

  mkdir /path/to/torax_dir && cd "$_"

Where ``/path/to/torax_dir`` should be replaced by a path of your choice.

Create a TORAX virtual env:

.. code-block:: console

  python3 -m venv toraxvenv

Activate the virtual env:

.. code-block:: console

  source toraxvenv/bin/activate

It is convenient to set up an alias for the above command.

.. install_torax:

Install TORAX from PyPI
-----------------------

This is the simplest way to install TORAX. If you don't plan to do any
development work, this is the recommended method.

.. code-block:: console

  pip install torax

Install TORAX from Github
-------------------------

If you plan to develop TORAX, we recommend installing from source. See
:ref:`contribution_tips` for an installation guide.

JAX environment variables
-------------------------

The following may optionally be added to ``~/.bashrc`` and will cause jax to
store compiled functions to the filesystem, avoiding recompilation in
some cases:

.. code-block:: console

  export JAX_COMPILATION_CACHE_DIR=<path of your choice, such as ~/jax_cache>
  export JAX_PERSISTENT_CACHE_MIN_ENTRY_SIZE_BYTES=-1
  export JAX_PERSISTENT_CACHE_MIN_COMPILE_TIME_SECS=0.0

For more information see :ref:`cache`.

(Optional) GPU support
----------------------

Install additional GPU support for JAX if your machine has a GPU:
https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#supported-platforms


(Optional) Install QLKNN-hyper
------------------------------

TORAX uses the |qlknn_7_11| transport model by default, an upgrade to the
QLKNN-hyper-10D (QLKNN10D) neural network surrogate model of QuaLiKiz
|qlknn10d|. QLKNN_7_11 is based on QuaLiKiz 2.8.1 which has an improved
collision operator compared to the QLKNN10D training set. QLKNN_7_11 training
data also includes impurity density gradients as an input feature and has better
coverage of the near-LCFS region compared to QLKNN-hyper-10D.

However, certain use-cases may require the use of QLKNN10D, such as for
comparative studies with other simulators. To install QLKNN10D, first
download the QLKNN dependencies at a location of your choice:

.. code-block:: console

  git clone https://gitlab.com/qualikiz-group/qlknn-hyper.git

To use QLKNN10D , you then need to set ``model_path`` in the
``transport`` section of your TORAX config to the path of the cloned repository.
See :ref:`configuration` for more details.
