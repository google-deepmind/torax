Development Roadmap
###################

Ongoing developments include:

* Implementation of forward sensitivity calculations w.r.t. control inputs and parameters
* More extensive tutorials
* Sawtooth model (Porcelli + reconnection)
* IMAS coupling

Longer term desired features include:

* Neoclassical transport + multi-ion transport, with a focus on heavy impurities
* Neoclassical tearing modes (modified Rutherford equation)
* Stationary-state solver
* Momentum transport

Contributions in line with the roadmap are welcome. In particular, TORAX is envisaged
as a natural framework for coupling of various ML-surrogates of physics models.
These could include surrogates for turbulent transport, neoclassical transport, heat
and particle sources, line radiation, pedestal physics, and core-edge integration, MHD, among others.
