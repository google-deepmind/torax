Development Roadmap
###################

Short term development plans include:

* Neoclassical transport with simple parameterized models
* Coupling to parameterized boundary models
* Implementation of forward sensitivity calculations w.r.t. control inputs and
  parameters

Longer term plans include:

* Rotation profile and ExB shearing impact in turbulent transport
* Multi-ion transport, with a focus on heavy impurities and neoclassical
  transport
* IMAS coupling
* Stationary-state solver
* Momentum transport
* Neoclassical tearing modes (modified Rutherford equation)

Contributions in line with the roadmap are welcome. In particular, TORAX
is envisaged as a natural framework for coupling of various ML-surrogates of
physics models. These could include surrogates for turbulent transport,
neoclassical transport, heat and particle sources, line radiation, pedestal
physics, and core-edge integration, MHD, among others.

See :ref:`contributing` and :ref:`contribution_tips` for more information.
