Development Roadmap
###################

A subset of planned upgrades includes:

* Multi-ion transport, with a focus on heavy impurities and neoclassical
  transport
* IMAS coupling
* Momentum transport
* Neoclassical tearing modes (modified Rutherford equation)
* Coupling to wider range of ML-surrogates for physics models

Contributions in line with the roadmap are welcome. In particular, TORAX
is envisaged as a natural framework for coupling of various ML-surrogates of
physics models. These could include surrogates for turbulent transport,
neoclassical transport, heat and particle sources, line radiation, pedestal
physics, and core-edge integration, MHD, among others.

See :ref:`contributing` and :ref:`contribution_tips` for more information.

and UX improvements, is available here:
