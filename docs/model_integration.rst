How to integrate new models
###########################

TORAX has a modular design which supports easy coupling of new physics models
such as sources, transport models, pedestal models, etc.

If you would like to add a new model and make use of this functionality this
currently requires using the internal TORAX functionality. We have not yet
exposed this as part of the TORAX API.

If you would like to use this please reach out to us. We aim to expose this
functionality as part of the TORAX API in the very near future to further
facilitate the integration of custom models.

For information on JAX-friendly interfacing with ML-surrogates of physics models, see :ref:`interfacing_with_surrogates`.
